description: Motivate, Inc. is the umbrella company that encompasses EPMG 360 (Multicultural), SPMG (55+), Military Life Media, and Faith and Family 360. All of these subsets of the agency work on behalf of companies and agencies looking to target different demographic markets in the United States through print and digital media.
description2: At Motivate I was a media account manager for all types of multicultural accounts with a specialization in the SPMG 55+ agency side. I planned, proposed, and executed multi-media accounts across the board for clients and agencies looking to target niche markets, while supervising the SPMG sales team. Some of the major national clients I managed included Pfizer, AstraZeneca, Amtrak, Wells Fargo, P&G, AARP, Kaiser, OMD Group, Sprint, and AT&T.
description3: As part of this role, I excelled at managing multiple accounts with placements in print and online all over the United States, often in hundreds of media at once. It was important to keep exact records, stay on top of deadlines, and be very detail oriented. I also helped out on the business development side of the business, creating RFPs for potential clients to ensure the highest degree of targeting, visibility, branding, and ROI. 
description4: Previous roles at Motivate included Account Executive, and Account Assistant.
