description: Branden Muhl is CEO of Mahaska, Co-Founder of Odin Brands, Founder and CIO of the B Group, and Co-Manager of the Greystone Hotel Project in Miami. Branden wanted his own executive website that showcased his many roles and could provide an outlet for him to post his biotech investment technical analyses. 
description2: I worked closely with Branden and our lead designer and development team on a website that portrayed his personality and executive roles perfectly. We designed a logo for himself and also for The B Group, his investment company, and created social media accounts for him to post blogs and content from his website as he added to it.
description3: Using analytics and tracking, I followed closely how a single blog post about a particular newsworthy investment could boost traffic and social media followers exponentially, and provided this information to the client. I continued to monitor and help with content as needed.
