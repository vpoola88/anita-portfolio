“Besides being a joy to work with, Anita is a take-charge person who is able to present creative ideas and communicate well with team members. In her sales role, she has successfully developed several client relationships that have resulted in increased revenue for our company. 

Anita was charged with, and excelled in, a supervisory role over the sales team, scheduling and implementing sales meetings, helping to increase communication and productivity of other employees. She has demonstrated superb attention to detail and organizational skills, streamlining work flow of the sales team, managing client accounts, and development of proposals and sales collateral.

I highly recommend Anita for employment. She is an intelligent, driven team player and would make a great asset to any organization.”
