description: Mahaska is a bottling and distribution company located in the Midwestern US. They wanted a branding and website refresh, with a focus on brand awareness. I worked directly with their management team and CEO on website goals, look and feel, and site map to develop their new website and brand. As lead account manager, I managed the design, development, and SEO/Analytics teams to create the website in phases.
description2: For their new social media initiative, I started and manage all accounts including Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, and YouTube. I also set up and ran a Facebook ad campaign for likes, using $2k to generate over 10k in targeted and relevant followers. I created and presented a social media presentation to their entire corporation, highlighting the importance and best practices for companies and employees in this day and age.
description3: We also worked to create back-ends for their HR and Accounting departments. For HR, we created a careers portal for job postings and management of their careers page online, as well as a digital online application for gathering potential hire information. This links to a digital online database for storing all HR data, which makes their process nearly paperless. For their accounting team, we created a streamlined accounting platform and UI interface with data stored on the cloud. This saves their team weeks of time and effort, making their process more efficient and cost-saving.
